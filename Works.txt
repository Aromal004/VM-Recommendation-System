CoreMark per core → raw compute efficiency.

CoreMark per dollar → performance-to-cost baseline.

$/vCPU-hour → key cost unit for comparison.

Latency (average + tail p95/p99) → critical for real-world workloads.

Throughput (TPS/QPS) → measures sustained workload capacity.

Memory utilization & bandwidth → important for memory-intensive workloads.

Network bandwidth (Gbps) → necessary for data-intensive applications.

IOPS (storage performance) → especially for database or disk-heavy tasks.

Cache performance (hit/miss rates) → useful when analyzing CPU differences (Intel vs AMD vs ARM).

$/GB-hour (RAM cost) → helps for memory-optimized VM families.

Resource saturation point → identifies limits where scaling is needed.

VM startup time → relevant for serverless or ephemeral workloads.
